## This is a second iteration of the minecraft stronghold triangulator. I hate advanced trigonometry so I came up with this fuckery that works surprisingly well.

### How to use

Throw an ender eye, look directly at it, press F3 + C and paste it into the triangulator.
Move to the side (the farther the better the accuracy, try 4 or more chunks) and do it again.
Congrats! You have pinpointed your stronghold with great accuracy!
