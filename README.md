## This is a second iteration of the minecraft stronghold triangulator. I hate advanced trigonometry so I came up with this fuckery that works surprisingly well.

### How to use

1. Run main.py

2. Throw an ender eye, look directly at it, press F3 + C and paste it into the triangulator.
3. Move to the side (the farther the better the accuracy, try 4 or more chunks) and do it again.
4. Congrats! You have pinpointed your stronghold with great accuracy! Go get that dragon [REDACTED]
