## This is a second iteration of the minecraft stronghold triangulator. I hate advanced trigonometry so I came up with this fuckery that works surprisingly well.

### What is it?

A little piece of code that lets you figure out where a minecraft stronghold is, all based off just two ender pearl throws.


### How do I use it?

1. Download and run `standalone.py` from the relases tab, (Make sure you got Python installed!)

2. Throw an ender eye, look directly at it, press `F3 + C`, paste it into the Triangulator and press Enter.
3. Move to the side (the farther the better the accuracy, try 4 or more chunks) and do it again.
4. Congrats! You have pinpointed your stronghold with great accuracy! Go get that dragon [REDACTED]


### Additional notes

`triangulator.py` offers the above in a python module formfactor. Additional info on how to use it can be found in the `module_example.py` file.
